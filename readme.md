# reactive

A sensible and faster alternative to Redux for JavaScript and TypeScript application state management in the frontend.

If you are creating a React application you should use [reactive-react](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/reactive-react) because it provides a helpful hook for monitoring state changes within a component. See the demonstration below.

A package for Vue will be available shortly.

For now, take a look at [reactive-react-demo](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/reactive-react) for a working NextJS demonstration.

### installation

`npm i @simon-robertson-online/reactive`
